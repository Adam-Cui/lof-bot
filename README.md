**Update: This project is not maintained for now due to my limited time. For QDII netvalue predictions, please refer to [jisilu](https://www.jisilu.cn/data/qdii/#qdiie), where they have realtime data based on version3.0 engine of xalpha for QDII predict, just use that.**

See the webpage [here](https://re-ra.xyz/lof-bot) for live.
